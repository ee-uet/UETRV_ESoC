# FPGA Implementation
## Requirements
- Nexys A7 FPGA Board
- Xilinx Vivado

The [wrapperProc.v](./rtl/wrapperProc.v) file contains the top module which instantiates the SoC_Tile and provides it with the clock. The SoC tile generated by Scala has been updated by replacing the multi-dimensional arrays with Xilinx block RAM. The contents of the instruction memory can be updated by updating the [main.mem](./bitstream/main.mem) file and then using the ```updatemem``` utility by executing the following command in the [bitstream](./bitstream/) folder to generate a new bitstream named ```out.bit```.

```bash
updatemem -force -debug -meminfo wrapperProc.mmi -data main.mem -bit wrapperProc.bit -proc proc/wb_inter_connect/imem/imem/IM/xpm_memory_spram_inst/xpm_memory_base_inst -out out.bit
```
